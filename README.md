# ncofdm V6.2
Version 6.2 has GNURadio companion examples in the folder. 'ncofdm_loopback.grc'is the ongoing effort on making a complete nc-ofdm chain. We have yet to decode the OFDM signal after finding the FFT boundry. 

# ncofdm v6.1
Version 6.1 is built on top of version 6. Version 6 had a long correlator with threshold adjustment. This version modifies the short correlator to allow threshold adjustment in the block itself by using average value of short corr.
